<h2 style="text-align: center">Entering decimals</h2>

<ul style="list-style-type: square">
	<li>
		<u>In general, give at least 5 decimal places.</u>
		<blockquote>
			Typically, if your answer is correct to 5 decimal places it will be marked correct, although the number of
			decimal places required may vary from problem to problem. When in doubt, give more decimal places.
		</blockquote>
	</li>

	<li>
		<u>If there is more than one correct answer, enter your answers as a comma separated list.</u>
		<blockquote>
			For example, if your answers are <code style="color: black">-3/2, 4/3, 2pi, e^3, 5</code> enter them as
			<code style="color: black">-1.5, 1.3333333, 6.2831853, 20.0855369, 5</code>.
		</blockquote>
	</li>

	<li>
		<u>Sometimes, fractions and certain operations are not allowed.</u>
		<blockquote>
			Usually, the operations that are not allowed include addition <code style="color: black">+</code>,
			subtraction <code style="color: black">-</code>, multiplication <code style="color: black">*</code>,
			division <code style="color: black">/</code>, and exponentiation <code style="color: black">^</code> (or
			<code style="color: black">**</code>). When these operations are not allowed, it is usually because you are
			expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.

	<li>
		<u>Sometimes, certain functions are not allowed.</u>
		<blockquote>
			Usually, the functions that are not allowed include square root <code style="color: black">sqrt( )</code>,
			absolute value <code style="color: black">| |</code> (or <code style="color: black">abs( )</code>), as well
			as other named functions such as <code style="color: black">sin( )</code>,
			<code style="color: black">ln( )</code>, etc. When these functions are not allowed, it is usually because
			you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.
