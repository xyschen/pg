		<u>If your answer is a decimal, give at least 5 decimal places.</u>
		<blockquote>
			Typically, if your answer is correct to 5 decimal places it will be marked correct, although the number of

		<u>Sometimes, fractions and certain operations are not allowed.</u>

			Usually, the operations that are not allowed include addition <code style="color: black">+</code>,

			division <code style="color: black">/</code>, and exponentiation <code style="color: black">^</code> (or
			<code style="color: black">**</code>). When these operations are not allowed, it is usually because you are
			expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.

		<u>Sometimes, certain functions are not allowed.</u>
		<blockquote>
			Usually, the functions that are not allowed include square root <code style="color: black">sqrt( )</code>,
			absolute value <code style="color: black">| |</code> (or <code style="color: black">abs( )</code>), as well
