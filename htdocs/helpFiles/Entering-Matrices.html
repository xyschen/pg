<h2 style="text-align: center">Entering Matrices</h2>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.25rem">When there is one big answer box</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		If the matrix has only one row, enter a list. For example, enter a 1 x 3 matrix as a comma separated list
		enclosed by square brackets: <blockquote><code>[1, 2, 3]</code></blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>
		If the matrix has more than one row, enter a list of lists. For example, enter a 2 x 3 matrix with 1, 2, 3 in
		the top row and 4, 5, 6 in the bottom row as: <blockquote><code>[ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] ]</code> </blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>
		If the matrix has only one column, enter a list of lists. For example, enter a 2 x 1 matrix with 1 in the top
		row and 2 in the bottom row as: <blockquote><code>[ [1], [2] ]</code></blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>
		Enter <b>DNE</b> (short for Does Not Exist) if the answer is that no matrix with the desired property exists.
	</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="font-size: 1.25rem">When there are multiple small answer boxes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		In this case, there is one answer box for each entry in the matrix. Do the obvious thing and enter one item
		(often a number or a formula) into each answer box.
	</li>
</ul>
