		<u>Both ^ and ** are used for exponentiation.</u>
		<blockquote>
			For example, <code style="color: black">x^2</code> and <code style="color: black">x**2</code> are the same,

		<u>
			Square roots have a named function, but other roots do not and should be entered using fractional exponents.
		</u>
		<blockquote>
			For example, the square root of 2 can be entered as <code style="color: black">sqrt(2)</code>,
			<code style="color: black">2^(1/2)</code>, or <code style="color: black">2**(1/2)</code>, but the cube root
			of 2 must be entered as <code style="color: black">2^(1/3)</code> or
			<code style="color: black">2**(1/3)</code>. The parentheses in <code style="color: black">2^(1/3)</code> are
			required, since <code style="color: black">2^1/3</code> will be interpreted as
			<code style="color: black">(2^1)/3 = 2/3</code>.

		<u>Sometimes, fractional exponents and certain operations are not allowed.</u>
		<blockquote>
			Usually, the operations that are not allowed include addition <code style="color: black">+</code>,
			subtraction <code style="color: black">-</code>, multiplication <code style="color: black">*</code>,
			division <code style="color: black">/</code>. When these operations are not allowed, it is usually because
			you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.

		<u>Sometimes, certain functions are not allowed.</u>
		<blockquote>
			Usually, the functions that are not allowed include square root <code style="color: black">sqrt( )</code>,
			absolute value <code style="color: black">| |</code> (or <code style="color: black">abs( )</code>), as well
			as other named functions such as <code style="color: black">sin( )</code>,
			<code style="color: black">ln( )</code>, etc. When these functions are not allowed, it is usually because
			you are expected to be able to simplify your answer, often without using a calculator.
