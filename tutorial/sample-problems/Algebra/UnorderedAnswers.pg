Rewrite the following expression without parentheses. Simplify your answer as
much as possible.

[`(xyz)^{[$a]} =`] [_____] [`\cdot`] [_____] [`\cdot`] [_____]

#: We use `UNORDERED_ANS(checker1, checker2, ...);` to evaluate the answers. It is
#: possible to withhold feedback and credit until everything is correct by using
#: the standard problem grader, which awards no partial credit and full credit
#: only when everything is correct.
