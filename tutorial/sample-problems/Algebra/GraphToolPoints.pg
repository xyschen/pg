#: by using interactive graphing tools. Load the `parserGraphTool.pl` macro for
#: this.

#:% section = setup
#: Two points are created at random.
#:
#: The `GraphTool` method creates the graph tool object. The only argument is
#: the correct answer. This is a string that contains a list of objects that
#: the student will be expected to graph. Each object is a brace delimited list
#: of the attributes of the object. The first attribute in each list is the
#: type of object to be graphed, `point` in this case. What the remaining
#: attributes are depend on the type. For a point, there is only one additional
#: attribute which is the point itself.
#:
#: The `->with` method is then used to set options for the `GraphTool` object.
#: In this case the options that are set are:
#:
#: * `bBox`: This is an array reference of four values `xmin, ymax, xmax, ymin`
#: indicating the upper left and lower right corners of the visible graph.
#: * `availableTools`: This determines which tools will be available for the
#: student to use.
#: * `showCoordinateHints`: Setting this to 0 turns off coordinate hints, which
#: would show students the coordinates the cursor is over.
#:
