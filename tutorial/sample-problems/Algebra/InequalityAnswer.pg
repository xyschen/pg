#: We require students to use inequalities by using `Context('Inequalities-Only')`.
#: If we had used `Context('Inequalities')` instead, then students could also enter
#: their answer using interval notation. For more details, please see
#: PODLINK('contextInequalities.pl').
#:
#: We use `formatStudentAnswer => 'parsed'` and `Compute()` so that the student's
#: answer is left as a fraction rather than reduced to a decimal.

$a   = random(3, 9);
$ans = Compute("x >= -10 / $a");

#:% section = statement
BEGIN_PGML
