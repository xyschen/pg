#: We set the test points to be positive integers to avoid errors when evaluating
#: the answer. Even if you expect students to enter answers such as `cos(pi * n) / n!`,
#: you should still restrict the domain to positive integers, because some students
#: may simplify this to `(-1)^n / n!` and receive errors because the answer checker
#: is substituting things such as n=0.5 into their formula.
#:
#: For more explanation on the `test_points` see PROBLINK('FormulaTestPoints.pg')
