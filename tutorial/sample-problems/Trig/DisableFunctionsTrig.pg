#:% section = setup
#: We choose a context that requires fractions as answers and does not allow decimals.
#: After constructing the formulas involving trig functions, we disable all functions
#: and re-enable the `sqrt()` function. This means that students are allowed to type in
#: fractions and square roots, but not much else (e.g., they'll get an error message
#: if they type in a trig function).
#:
#: Note that `$f1` and `$f2` are MathObject Formulas, which do not get reduced since `pi`
#: is set to keep its name. If `$f1` and `$f2` used `Compute` instead, then the results
#: would be -1 and 0.866... instead of cos(\pi) and sin(\pi/3) as desired.
Context('Fraction-NoDecimals');

# Prevent pi from becoming 3.1415... and cos(pi) from
# becoming -1.
Context()->constants->set(pi => { keepName => 1 });

# The next context changes are not necessary to
# prevent cos(pi) from becoming -1, but they cannot hurt.
Context()->flags->set(
    reduceConstants         => 0,
    reduceConstantFunctions => 0
);

$f1 = Formula('cos(pi)');
$f2 = Formula('sin(pi/3)');

Context()->functions->disable('All');
Context()->functions->enable('sqrt');

$answer1 = Compute('-1');
$answer2 = Compute('sqrt(3)/2');

#:% section = statement
BEGIN_PGML
Enter your answers as simplified fractions.

+ [`[$f1] =`] [_]{$answer1}{15}

+ [`[$f2] =`] [_]{$answer2}{15}
END_PGML

#:% section = solution
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The cosine of an angle is zero when the angle is an integer multiple of [`\pi`].
