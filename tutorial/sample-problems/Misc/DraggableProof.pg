#:% section = setup
#: The `DraggableProof` function takes an arrayref of correct statements,
#: followed (optionally) by extra statements. See
#: PODLINK('the Draggable Proof POD', 'draggableProof.pl') for more options.

    # These are the correct statements of the proof in the correct order.

        'We can then write \(2 = \frac{4k^2}{b^2}\) or \(b^2 = 2k^2\)',
        'Therefore \(b^2\) is even, so \(b\) is also even',
        'If \(a\) and \(b\) are both even, then the initial assumption that \(\text{gcd}(a,b) = 1\) is contradicted.',
