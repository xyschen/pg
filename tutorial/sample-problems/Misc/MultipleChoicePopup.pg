#:% section = setup
#: To create a radio object, use `$popup = PopUp([choices,...],correct);`
#: For details, see parserPopUp.pl The context is not really necessary, but multiple
#: choice questions are often follow-up questions, so we leave it in.
#:
#: The `parsePopUp.pl` macro has two methods `PopUp` and `DropDown`. The former requires
#: that a default `?` is coded in the first element.  The latter will put that in
#: unless the `placeholder` option is there.
#:
#: Note: setting the `$showPartialCorrectAnswers` to 0 is often desirable for
#: multiple choice problems so students don't know which part is incorrect and
#: could therefore just guess the answer.

$popup = PopUp([ '?', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Green' ], 'Blue');

$dropdown1 = DropDown([ 'Red', 'Blue', 'Green' ], 'Green');

$dropdown2 =
    DropDown([ 'Red', 'Blue', 'Green' ], 'Red', placeholder => 'Select One');

#:% section = statement
BEGIN_PGML
Select my favorite color [_]{$popup}

**Same thing, but using DropDown**

Select my favorite color [_]{$dropdown1}

**Same thing, but using DropDown with placeholder option**

Select my favorite color [_]{$dropdown2}
