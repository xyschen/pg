#:% type = [Sample, technique]
#:% categories = [essay]

#:% section = preamble
#: Use the `PGessaymacros.pl` for the essay answer
#: and `parserPopUp.pl` for the multiple choice drop
#: down menu.  Setting `$showPartialCorrectAnswers = 0;`
#: means that students will not receive feedback on whether
#: their answers are correct.
#: The all-or-nothing problem grader (the standard problem grader)
#: is used in order to withhold assigning any credit when the student
#: submits an answer.  This allows the professor to manually determine
#: what percentage the student should get.
#: If the standard problem grader was not used here, then the default
#: problem grader (the average problem grader) would award
#: 50 percent credit to students who answer the multiple choice
#: question correct.

#: Clearly communicate to the student the expectations
#: of the problem and how it will be graded.  The `essay_box(w, h)`
#: is resizable and takes inputs for initial width and height.

#: Note that `essay_cmp()` is not associated with any object
#: (i.e., it is **not** `$essay->cmp()`).
#:
#: The essay answer must be graded manually by the instructor.  Hand grading is
#: done either (1) by viewing the homework set and clicking the **Grade problem**
#: link in the rightmost column of the problem list, or (2) by checking the
#: **Problem Grader** checkbox in the problem and clicking
#: **Preview My Answers** or **Check Answers**, or (3) by clicking on
#: **Statistics** in Instructor Tools menu, selecting the homework set, and
#: clicking the **Manual Grader** link under the problem number, or (4) by
#: clicking the **Grade Problem** link after the problem number on the
#: **Set Detail** page.
