#:% section = setup
#: The macro `randomPerson.pl` provides functionality to
#:
#: * select a random name from a user-defined or default list with pronouns.
#: * provide correct pronouns as well as verb conjugation.
#:
#: The `randomPerson(n => 3)` subroutine selects 3 unique random persons.
#:
#: See the `randomNamesPronouns.pl` POD for more information and example.
($p1, $p2, $p3) = randomPerson(n => 3);

$n = random(20, 30, 2);
$c = random(4,  8,  2);

#:% section = statement
#: The objects `$p1, $p2` and `$p3` are `Person` objects and we can call the methods
#: for name, and the pronouns `subject, possessive, possession` and `object` as well
#: as the capitalized versions of each of these.  In addition, there is a `verb`
#: method to conjugate most verbs as well as some irregular ones, like `do`
#: which returns the correct conjugation of "to do".
BEGIN_PGML
[$p1] has a ribbon of length [$n] cm.  [$p1->Subject] [$p1->verb('cut')]
[$c] cm off the ribbon and [$p1->verb('give')] the piece to [$p1->possessive]
friend [$p2].

[$p1] then [$p1->verb('divide')] the rest in half and [$p1->verb('give')]
half to [$p1->possessive] friend [$p3].

How much ribbon [$p1->do] [$p1] have left? [___]{Real(($n-$c)/2)}
