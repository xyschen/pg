#:% section=setup
#: We generate the plot parametrically for the radial functions `z=cos(r^2/4)`
#: and `z=r*sin^2(t)`.
#:
#: This occurs with `x=u*cos(v)` and `y=u*sin(v)`, where `u` and `v` are
#: used as the radial and angular variables respectively.  These are the
#: default variables used.
#:
#: The second plot changes the variables to `r` and `t` and shows a function
#: with a non-rotational symmetric plot.
#:
#: The `addSurface` is very flexible, but if you are plotting a function in
#: cylindrical coordinates, then the first two functions should remain the
#: same.
#:
#: See PODLINK('plotly3D.pl') for more information on options.
