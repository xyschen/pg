#:% section = setup
#: The first answer is a standard mulitivariable calculus question. There are several
#: different ways to specify the input to `ImplicitPlane`, which are detailed in the POD
#: documentation. It is also possible to do some more complicated manipulations with
#: the vectors and points, which is detailed in the problem techniques section.
#:
#: When the `ImplicitPlane` context has only two variables, it rephrases error messages
#: in terms of lines. If you want students to be able to enter an equation for a line
#: in the most general form, or if you have a vertical line to check (or just a
#: constant equation such as `x = 3`), you can use the `ImplicitPlane` context to reliably
#: check these answers.
Context('ImplicitPlane');
Context()->variables->are(x => 'Real', y => 'Real', z => 'Real');

$A = non_zero_point3D(-5, 5);
$N = non_zero_vector3D(-5, 5);

$ans1 = ImplicitPlane($A, $N);
$ans2 = ImplicitPlane('4x + 3y = 12');
$ans3 = ImplicitPlane('x = 3');

a. Enter an equation for the plane through the point [`[$A]`] and perpendicular
to [`[$N]`].

b. Enter an equation for the line in the [`xy`]-plane with [`x`]-intercept [`3`]
and [`y`]-intercept [`4`].

c. Enter an equation for the vertical line in the [`xy`]-plane through the
point [`(3,1)`].
