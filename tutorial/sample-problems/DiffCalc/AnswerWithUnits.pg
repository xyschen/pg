#: We use the differentiation operator `->D('t')` and the evaluation method `->eval()` to
#: construct the derivative and evaluate it as a function. If we were writing several
#: questions like this with different height functions, using the differentiation and
#: evaluation methods would really speed up the writing.

BEGIN_PGML
Suppose the height of a falling object, in feet above the ground, is given
by [`h(t) = [$h]`] for [`t \geq 0`], where time is measured in seconds.

a. What is the velocity of the object?  Include units in your answer.

    [_]{$ans1}{15}

b. What is the velocity of the object when it hits the ground?  Include units in
your answer.

    [_]{$ans2}{15}

c. What is the acceleration of the object?  Include units in your answer.

    [_]{$ans3}{15}

Note: use units in all answers. [@ helpLink('units') @]*
