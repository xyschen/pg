#: We need no additions to the PG file except in the text section, where we use
#: the `htmlLink` function to insert the link. There are four examples here in
#: all, the page to load is given as the first argument to `htmlLink`, and the
#: text to display as the link as the second argument.
#:
#: 1. This is a link to a general URL.
#:
#: 2. The second example shows how to link to a page that is in the same directory
#: on the WeBWorK server as the PG file: the alias function puts in the correct
#: link for this file. Setting the target to be _blank will open a new (blank)
#: window or tab.
#:
#: 3. The third example shows how to link to a page that is under the html
#: subdirectory of a course's main directory. In this example, which is taken
#: from the problem `Library/Rochester/setDiffEQ6AutonomousStability/ur_de_6_3.pg`,
#: phaseplaneplotters is a subdirectory that has been added under the course's
#: html directory. The course's html directory can be linked using `${htmlURL}`
#: as in the example given or by using
#: `alias("${htmlDirectory}phaseplaneplotters/index.html")`.
#:
#: 4. The fourth example uses the built-in `helpLink` feature of WeBWorK. The
#: following is a list of all help topics: angle, decimal, equation, exponent
#: formula, fraction, inequality, limit, log, matrix, number, point, vector,
#: interval, unit, syntax.
