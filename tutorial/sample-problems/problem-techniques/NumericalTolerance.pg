#:% section = setup
#: This shows three different ways of setting the toltype and tolerance of the answer. The
#: `tolType` can be `absolute` (specifying a decimal distance from the correct answer that
#: will be allowed) or `relative` (specifying a percent error that will be allowed).
#:
#: Thus if the correct answer is 17, a tolerance of 0.01 will mean that the student answer
#: must be in the interval `(16.99,17.01)` if the `tolType` is `absolute`, and in the interval
#: `(16.83,17.17)` if `tolType` is `relative` (or omitted, as relative tolerance is the default).
#:
#: 1. The default `Context('Numeric')` is used (but not needed) and within the Compute call,
#: the `tolerance` type and level is set.
#:
#: 2. The `tolerance` and `toltype` is set on the answer check with the cmp call.  See the
#: problem statement below.
#:
#: 3. The `tolerance` and `toltype` can be set on the `Context`.  This is useful if the desired
#: toltype and/or tolerance is the same for many answer.  Typically this would go at the
#: top of the setup section.
$ans1 = Compute('1.5708')->cmp(
    tolType   => 'absolute',

$ans2 = Compute('1.5708');

    tolerance => 0.0001,
    tolType   => 'absolute',
);
