#:% section = setup
#: The DraggableSubsets call visually creates a set of regions called buckets that
#: labelled boxes can be dragged between. The general form is
#:```{#draggable-subsets-usage .perl}
#: $draggable = DraggableSubsets(
#:        $full_set,
#:        $answer_sets,
#:        %options
#:    );
#:```
#:
#: where `$full_set` is the set of all labelled boxes.  The `$answer_sets` is a nested
#: array reference of distribution of the correct subsets.  There are many options. The
#: example here shows the use of `DefaultSubsets` which shows how to label and initialize
#: the buckets. The `AllowNewBuckets` option allows the student in add a new bucket (1)
#: or not (0).  The `OrderedSubsets` option requires that the subsets in the student
#: answer be the same as in the correct answer.
#:
#: See the [DraggableProofs](../Misc/DraggableProof.html) for an example of
#: how to create drag and drop proof problems.
