#: Using `Context('Inequalities-Only')`, if the student enters the inequality
#: `-16 <= y <= 9` their answer will be marked correct, but the equivalent
#: interval `[-16,9]` would be incorrect. If we had used
#: `Context('Inequalities')` instead, both the inequality and the interval
#: would be marked correct.
#:
#: Uncommenting the lines containing `EmptySet` creates an empty set as a named
#: constant and uses that name.
#:
#: Uncommenting `Context()->flags->set(ignoreEndpointTypes=>1);` would also mark
#: the student answers `-16 < y < 9` or `-16 <= y < 9` or `-16 < y <= 9` correct.
Context("Inequalities-Only");
Context()->variables->add(y => "Real");
# Context()->constants->add(EmptySet => Set());
# Context()->flags->set(noneWord=>"EmptySet");
# Context()->flags->set(ignoreEndpointTypes=>1);

# f(x) = x^2 - 16 on -1 <= x <= 5
$f = Formula("x^2 - 16");

$range = Compute("-16 <= y <= 9");

Context()->variables->remove("x");

#:% section=statement
BEGIN_PGML
What is the range of
[`y = f(x) = [$f] `] on the domain [` -1 \leq x \leq 5 `]?


Range: [___]{$range}

Enter your answer using inequalities (not intervals).
