#:% section = preamble
#: We need to load the `parserFunction.pl` macro, and then use one of its
#: routines to define a new function that students may type in their answers.

#:% section = setup
#: First, we define a function `f(x,y)`.  The actual function doesn't matter but shouldn't
#: be easily guessed, since a student could put in `sin(x*y)-exp(y)` and get the answer correct.
#:
#: This is a useful technique for any problem that the question is about a generic function
#: rather than a specific one.

#:% section = statement
BEGIN_PGML
Given a surface [`z = f(x,y)`], what is the equation for the [`z`] -coordinate
of the surface along a line having [`y=3`], shifted four units to the right?

[`z = `] [_____]{$ans}
