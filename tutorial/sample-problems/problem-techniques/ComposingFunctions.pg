$f = Formula("sqrt(u)");
$g = Formula("x^2+$a");

#:% section = statement
BEGIN_PGML
Express the function [`y = \sqrt{x^2 + [$a]}`] as a composition [`y = f(g(x))`]
of two simpler functions [`y = f(u)`] and [`u = g(x)`].

	[`f(u) =`] [___]

	[`g(x) =`] [___]
END_PGML

#:% section = answer
#: This must be called with the method `COMPOSITION_ANS` with the arguments that
#: will test for `f(g(x))`
COMPOSITION_ANS($f, $g);

Solution explanation goes here.
