#:% section=setup
#: We use the `LayoutTable` function from `niceTables.pl` to demonstrate some
#: of it's features.
#:
#: The basic form of a `LayoutTable` is identical to that of `DataTable` or
#:```{#datatable .perl}
#:$table = LayoutTable([
#:   [row1],
#:   [row2],
#:   ...
#:   [rowN]
#: ],
#: options);
#:```
#: where the data goes in as an array ref of array refs.  However, if using
#: a table for layout purposes, `LayoutTable` has more appropriate default
#: options.  See
#: PODLINK('the niceTables.pl POD','niceTables.pl') for more details.
#:
#: Notice in this example that we make two columns.  The left column is
#: written using older style PG, with `$PAR` as a paragraph break.
$a   = random(0, 3);
$ans = Compute("x^2+$a")->reduce;

$left = qq|
A common situation is that there is a problem with a graph and
the problem is on the left column and the graph is on the right
column.
$PAR
This even works if we add an equation like \(e^{i\pi}+1 = 0\)
$PAR
Or if we add an answer blank.
$PAR
A formula for the function graphed on the right is \(f(x)=\)| . ans_rule(10);

$graph = createTikZImage();
$graph->tikzLibraries('arrows.meta');
$graph->BEGIN_TIKZ
\tikzset{>={Stealth[scale=1.5]}}
\filldraw[
    draw=LightBlue,
    fill=white,
    rounded corners=10pt,
    thick,use as bounding box
] (-6,7) rectangle (6,-1);
\draw[->,thick] (-6,0) -- (6,0) node[above left,outer sep=3pt] {\(x\)};
\foreach \x in {-5,...,-1,1,2,...,5}
    \draw(\x,5pt) -- (\x,-5pt) node [below] {\(\x\)};
\draw[->,thick] (0,-1) -- (0,7) node[below right,outer sep=3pt] {\(y\)};
\foreach \y in {1,...,6}
    \draw (5pt,\y) -- (-5pt,\y) node[left] {\(\y\)};
\draw[blue,ultra thick] plot[domain=-2.5:2.5,smooth] (\x,{\x*\x+$a});
END_TIKZ

#:% section=statement
#: Since the only output is the table, we use this line to output the
#: problem as the two columns. This is the `LayoutTable` with only
#: one row.
TEXT(LayoutTable(
    [ [ $left, image($graph, width => 400, tex_size => 600) ] ],
    align => 'lc'
));

#:% section = answer
#: Since `ans_rule` is used to produce answer blanks, this in needed.
ANS($ans->cmp);
