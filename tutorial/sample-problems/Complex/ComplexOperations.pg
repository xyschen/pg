#:% section = setup
#: To use complex numbers, we need to switch context with `Context('Complex')`.
#: There are many ways to create a complex number.  Notice on the 4th one
#: `i` is defined and can be used naturally.
#:
#: Also, the standard operations go through as expected.
#: Notice that for the first two questions, we give the store the answer in
#: a variable.
Context('Complex');

$z0 = Complex(non_zero_random(-5, 4), non_zero_random(-5, 5));
$z1 = Complex([ -1, 4 ]);
$z2 = Complex("2-4i");
$z3 = 3 - 4 * i;

$ans1 = $z0 + $z1;
$a0   = non_zero_random(-4, 4);
$a1   = random(1, 5);
$ans2 = Compute("$a0*$z1-$a1*$z2");

#:% section = statement
#: Note that in the last three answer blanks, the correct answer is
#: in the `{}` instead of stored as a variable, like the first two.
#: Either method is correct and it varies on which to use.
#: Recall that the perl power `**` is used in the last one.

Let [`z_0=[$z0]`], [`z_1=[$z1]`], [`z_2=[$z2]`] and [`z_3=[$z3]`]. Find

[`z_0+z_1=`] [___]{$ans1}

[`[$a0]z_1-[$a1]z_2=`] [_____]{$ans2}

[`z_1z_2=`] [___]{$z1*$z2}

[``\frac{z_3}{z_0}= ``] [___]{$z3/$z0}

[`` z_2^2=``] [__]{$z2**2}
