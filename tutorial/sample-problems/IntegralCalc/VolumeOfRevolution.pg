#: To keep the code that needs to be modified compartmentalized, we define the
#: functions involved, the limits of integration, the integrand, the volume, and
#: an array of weights (which sum to 100) for each of these answers.
#:
#: The code for correctly displaying the answer blanks creates `$integral` which
#: will be displayed correctly both in TeX and HTML modes. Notice that it uses
#: `NAMED_ANS_RULE(name, width)` for all of the answer blanks instead of
#: `ans_rule(width)`.
#:
#: We define `$integral` to display the integral and answer
#: blanks correctly using a `LayoutTable` from PODLINK('niceTables.pl').

#:% section = statement
#: Standard PGML and latex is used to describe the problem.  The integral
#: that was formatted using a table above is inserted with `[$integral]*`
#:
#: A note is added that specifies for the students how the
#: answer will be graded (the `weightedGrader.pl` macro does not do this
#: automatically, as some other graders do.)
BEGIN_PGML
Set up and evaluate an integral for the volume of the solid of revolution
obtained by rotating the region bounded by [`y = x`] and [`y = x^2`] about
the [`x`]-axis.

[$integral]*

[@ MODES(
    TeX  => '',
    HTML => << "END_HTML"
${BITALIC}${BBOLD}Note:${EBOLD} You can earn
$weights[0]${PERCENT} for the upper limit of integration,
$weights[1]${PERCENT} for the lower limit of integration,
$weights[2]${PERCENT} for the integrand, and
$weights[3]${PERCENT} for the finding the volume.

#:% section = answer
#: To install the answer evaluator call
#: `NAMED_WEIGHTED_ANS(name => $answer->cmp()->withPostFilter(), weight)`
#: instead of using `ANS($answer->cmp()->withPostFilter())`. Providing
#: customized answer hints for students is a good idea, because the whole point
#: of this homework exercise it to learn how to set up this integral using
#: proper notation. If we just wanted to ask for the volume, we could have done
#: it using only one answer blank.
#:
#: If you would like to give full credit for the overall volume, you can
#: replace the last `NAMED_WEIGHTED_ANS` with
#:```{.perl}
#:CREDIT_ANS($vol->cmp, [ 'upperlimit', 'lowerlimit', 'integrand' ], $weights[3]);
#:```
#:
#: Of course, if you want to give equal credit, then each of the
#: `NAMED_WEIGHTED_ANS` commands can be replaced with `ANS`, however
#: make sure that they listed in order.
NAMED_WEIGHTED_ANS(upperlimit => $upper->cmp, $weights[0]);
NAMED_WEIGHTED_ANS(lowerlimit => $lower->cmp, $weights[1]);
NAMED_WEIGHTED_ANS(
    integrand => $int->cmp->withPostFilter(AnswerHints(
        Formula('pi x^2 - pi x^4 dx') =>
            "Don't forget to multiply every term in the integrand by dx",
        Formula('pi (x^2 - x^4)')  => "Don't forget the differential dx",
        Formula('pi(x^4 - x^2)dx') => 'Is the parabola above the line?',
        Formula('pi(x^4 - x^2)')   => 'Is the parabola above the line?',
        Formula('pi(x - x^2)')     => 'Make sure you use the disk method.',
        Formula('pi(x - x^2)dx')   => 'Make sure you use the disk method.',
