=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head2 Examples:



=cut

BEGIN {
	be_strict();    # an alias for use strict.  This means that all global variable must contain main:: as a prefix.
}

package AnswerIO;

# Code for saving Answers to a file
# function, not a method
# Code in .pm files can access the disk.

sub saveAnswerToFile {
	my $logFileID = shift;
	my $string    = shift;
	# We want to allow acces only to predetermined files
	# We accomplish this by translating legal IDs into a file name

	my $rh_allowableFiles = {
		preflight     => 'preflight.log',
		questionnaire => 'questionnaire.txt',

	};
	my $error       = undef;
	my $logFileName = $rh_allowableFiles->{$logFileID};
	if (defined($logFileName)) {
		my $accessLog = Global::getCourseLogsDirectory() . $logFileName;
		#$error = "access Log is $accessLog";
		#$error .="string is $string";
		open(LOG, ">>$accessLog") or $error .= "Can't open course access log $accessLog";
		print LOG $string;    #no format is forced on data.
		close(LOG);
	} else {
		$error = "Error: The file ID $logFileID is not recognized.";
