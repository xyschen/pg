#New highly object-oriented list construct
#This List.pm is the super class for all types of lists
#As of 6/5/2000 the three list sub-classes are Match, Select, Multiple
#RDV

=head1 NAME

	List.pm  -- super-class for all list structures

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=pod

List.pm is not intended to be used as a stand alone object.

It is a super-class designed to be inherited by sub-classes that,
through small changes, can be used for a variety of different
questions that involve some sort of list of questions and/or answers.

List.pm has been used to construct Match.pm, Select.pm, and Multiple.pm.

These three classes are objects that can be used to create the
following question types:

B<Matching list:>
Given a list of questions and answers, match the correct answers to the
questions. Some answers may be used more than once and some may not be used at
all. The order of the answers is usually random but some answers can be
appended to the end in a set order (i.e. 'None of the above'). Answers are
given corresponding letters as shortcuts to typing in the full answer. (i.e.
the answer to #1 is A).

B<Select list:>
Given a list of questions and (usually) implied answers, give the correct
answer to each question. This is intended mainly for true/false questions or
other types of questions where the answers are short and can therefore be typed
in by the user easily.  If a select list is desired but the answers are too long
to really type in, a popup-list of the answers can be used.

B<Multiple choice:>
Given a single question and a list of answers, select the single correct answer.
This structure creates a standard multiple choice question as would be seen on a
standardize test.  Extra answers are entered along with the question in a simple
format and (as with Match.pm), if necessary, can be appended in order at the end
(i.e. 'None of the above')

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Variables and methods available to sub-classes

=head3 Variables

	questions				# array of questions as entered using qa()
	answers					# array of answers as entered using qa()
	extras					# array of extras as entered using extra()

	selected_q				# randomly selected subset of "questions"
	selected_a				# the answers for the selected questions
	selected_e				# randomly selected subset of "extras"

	ans_rule_len			# determines the length of the answer blanks
							# default is 4

	slice					# index used to select specific questions
	shuffle					# permutation array which can be applied to slice
							# to shuffle the answers

	inverted_shuffle		# the inverse permutation array

	rf_print_q				# reference to any subroutine which should
							# take ($self, @questions) as parameters and
							# output the questions in a formatted string.
							# If you want to change the way questions are
							# printed, write your own print method and set
							# this equal to a reference to to that method
							# (i.e. $sl->rf_print_q = ~~&printing_routine_q)

	rf_print_a				# reference to any subroutine which should
							# take ($self, @answers) as parameters and
							# output the answers in a formatted string.
							# If you want to change the way answers are
							# printed, write your own print method and set
							# this equal to a reference to to that method
							# (i.e. $sl->rf_print_a = ~~&printing_routine_a)

	ra_pop_up_list		    # Field used in sub classes that use pop_up_list_print_q
							# to format the questions. (Placing a pop_up_list next to
							# each question instead of an answer blank.
							# It is initialized to
							# => [no_answer =>'  ?', T => 'True', F => 'False']

	ans_rule_len			# field which can be used in the question printing routines
							# to determine the length of the answer blanks before the questions.

=head3 Methods

	qa( array )				# accepts an array of strings which can be used
							# for questions and answers

	extra( array )			# accepts an array of strings which can be used
							# as extra answers

	print_q					# yields a formatted string of question to be
							# matched with answer blanks
	print_a					# yields a formatted string of answers

	choose([3, 4], 1)		# chooses questions indexed 3 and 4 and one other
							# randomly
	choose_extra([3, 4], 1) # choooses extra answers indexed 3 and 4 and one
							# other
	makeLast( array )		# accepts an array of strings (like qa) which will
							# be forced to the end of the list of answers.

	ra_correct_ans			# outputs a reference to the array of correct answers
	correct_ans				# outputs a concatenated string of correct answers (only for Multiple)

=head2 Usage

	None -- see SYNOPSIS above
