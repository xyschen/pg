=head1 NAME

parserSolutionFor.pl - An answer checker that checks if a student's answer
satisifies an implicit equation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Parser class that implements an answer checker that
checks if a student's answer satisfies an implicit equation.
We define a SolutionFor object class that lets you specify an
equality that the student answer must satisfy, and a point that
DOES satify the equation.  The overloaded == operator will
check if a given point satisfies the given equality.

Use SolutionFor(equality,point[,options]) to create a SolutionFor object.
The equality is a Formula object containing an equality, or a string
representing such a formula, and the point is a Point object or string
containing a point that satisfies the equation (to be used as the
correct answer when the student asks to see the answers).

The variables to use are declared in the Context in the usual way,
and the coordinates of the student point will be considered to be in
alphabetical order.  You can override this by supplying the vars=>[...]
option, where you specify the variable names in the order you want the
student to give them.  E.g., vars=>['y','x'] will make the student answer
represent the point (y,x) rather than the default (x,y).

Usage examples:

    Context("Vector")->variables->are(x=>'Real',y=>'Real');
    $f = SolutionFor("x^2 = cos(y)","(1,0)");
    $f = SolutionFor("x^2 - y = 0",[2,4]);
    $f = SolutionFor("x^2 - y = 0",Point(4,2),vars=>['y','x']);

Then use

    ANS($f->cmp);

to get the answer checker for $f.

You can use $f->{f} to get the Formula object for the equality used
in the object, and $f->f(point) to determine if the given point is
a solution to the equality or not.  For example:

    BEGIN_PGML
    A solution to [` $f->{f} `] is [`(x,y)=`] [____]{$f}
    END_PGML
