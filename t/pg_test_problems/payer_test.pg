Use the chain rule to find the derivative of composed functions. $BR   
The function of  \( f(t) = ($aa t^2 + $bb t + $c )^{-8}   \)  is a composed function because the outer function of the negative exponent is "holding" the inner function of a quadratic equation. The chain rule applies the derivative on the outermost function first and then works inward applying the derivative to each successive inner function in a series of products. With each application of the derivative on the outer function the inner contents are left alone. In this way a "chain" of derivative products are formed. The chain rule can be expressed with notation as shown below: $BR
 $BR
Given that `p(x) = f(g(x))`, $BR
$BR
The derivative is applied by the chain rule: $BR
$BR
\( p'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \)   $BR
$BR
Apply the derivative to `f(t)`: $BR
$BR
\( f(t) = ($aa t^2 + $bb t + $c )^{-8}\) $BR
$BR
Apply the prime tics for the chain rule:$BR
$BR
\( f'(t) = \left(($aa t^2 + $bb t + $c )^{-8}\right)' \left($aa t^2 + $bb t + $c \right)'\) $BR
$BR
Apply the derivative: $BR
$BR
\( f'(t) = -8($aa t^2 + $bb t + $c )^{-9} \left($a2 t + $bb \right)\) $BR
$BR
Push the quantity of the negative exponent down to the denominator: $BR
$BR
\( \displaystyle{f'(t) = \frac{-8($a2 t + $bb) }{($aa t^2 + $bb t + $c )^{9}} } \) $BR
$BR
Pull any common factors from the numerator: $BR
$BR
\( \displaystyle{f'(t) = \frac{-8 \cdot $gcd($a3 t + $b3) }{($a t^2 + $bb t + $c )^{9}} } \) $BR
$BR
Combine factors for the reduced derivative: $BR
$BR
\( \displaystyle{f'(t) = \frac{$gc8($a3 t + $b3) }{($aa t^2 + $bb t + $c )^{9}}}  \) $BR
$BR
Evaluate the derivative at `t = $t1`: $BR
$BR
\( \displaystyle{f'($t1) = \frac{$gc8($a3 \cdot ($t1) + $b3) }{($aa \cdot ($t1)^2 + $bb \cdot ($t1) + $c )^{9}}}  \) $BR
$BR
Combine factors and squared values:$BR
$BR
\( \displaystyle{f'($t1) = \frac{$gc8($at3 + $b3) }{($aa \cdot $tsq + $bt1 + $c )^{9}}}  \) $BR
$BR
Combine factors and terms:$BR
$BR
\( \displaystyle{f'($t1) = \frac{$gc8($abt3) }{($atsq + $btc )^{9}}}  \) $BR
$BR
Combine factors and terms:$BR
$BR
\( \displaystyle{f'($t1) = \frac{$num }{($den1 )^{9}} =\frac{$num }{$den2} }  \) $BR
$BR
An exact value:
$BR
\( \displaystyle{f'($t1) = \frac{$num3 }{$den3} }  \) $BR
$BR
A decimal approximation: $BR
$BR
\( \displaystyle{f'($t1) \approx $ans}  \) $BR
$BR
Note that scientific notation in webwork is sometimes written in this form:$BR
$BR
\[3.1456E-4 = 3.1456 \times 10^{-4} = 0.00031456 \]$BR
